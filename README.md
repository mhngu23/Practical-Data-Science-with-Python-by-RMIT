File including:
* Assignment 2 submit.ipynb
- Develop a model which can successfully predict the decision of a donor on whether he/she would donate their blood in March 2007 using the “Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set” collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository database.
- The dataset that was used contained 5 columns and 748 rows entries, the dataset provides that there were 570 “no” entries and 178 “yes” entries for the blood donations in March 2007.
- Every attribute was examined and observed before the model was developed using the <.corr> function as well as multiple figures including histogram, bar chart, density, and boxplots.   
- The final model was decided based on its performance, including the analysis of overall accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report.
- Each of the model was split with 3 different training and test set ratios of 80/20, 60/40 and 40/60 and the crucial parameters were tuned automatically.
